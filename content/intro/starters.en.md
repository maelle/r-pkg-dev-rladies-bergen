Before you start writing packages...

* Set up your system as [explained in the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html)

* Learn how to write functions. Three useful links:
    * [Write your own R functions](https://stat545.com/functions-part1.html), stat 545 course by Jenny Bryan and The STAT 545 TAs;
    * [Chapter about functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) in the book "R for Data Science" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham;
    * [Fun with Functions talk](https://www.kaylea.co.uk/talk/funwithfunctions/) by Kaylea Haynes, R-Ladies Manchester.
    
Recommended but not necessary...
  
* I use the usethis package a lot :robot: :sparkles:, and recommend doing so. Follow [usethis setup article](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html) in particular [_"Use usethis or devtools in interactive work"_](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#use-usethis-or-devtools-in-interactive-work-1) and the Git/GitHub stuff.

* If you use GitLab, not GitHub, you can follow [Heidi Seibold's instructions _"Setup Git RStudio GitLab"_](https://gitlab.com/HeidiSeibold/setup-git-rstudio-gitlab). There is no helper similar to `usethis::use_github()` to my knowledge.

* You should be able to follow the course and manage a blog without any git knowledge. Now for later, if you feel curious about version control, I'd recommend checking out [happygitwithr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs, Jim Hester; [Suzan Baert's blog post about git](https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/03/reflections-4-months-of-github/) and ["Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?"](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) by Jenny Bryan.
